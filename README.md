# Valorant Predictions

### Introduction
Valorant is a 5v5 Video Game with a growing esports scene. Valorant Champions Tour (VCT) is Riot's tournament for the game, where the best teams across the world compete to be crowned as the best in the world.

### Goals of this project
There are a lot of similarities between esports and traditional sports. One being betting and the audience trying to predict who's going to win. However, because the game is rather new, there hasn't been much analysis on match data being posted online compared to traditional sports. The goal of this project is to use data from previous matches in the VCT to predict winners of the upcoming games.

In order to achieve this I have a set of mini goals to achieve this:
* train a model with 70% accuracy
* train a model that beats audience concensus 
* train a model that beats twitter sentiments

The last 2 goals might be a bit of a stretch given how fast metas can change and how volitile esport rosters are.
